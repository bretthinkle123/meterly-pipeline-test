# guard-source-markers.sh — deterministic block (audit E3) against shipping a tree
# that still carries an experimental / reverted-fix marker in CHANGED source.
#
# The M5 hazard: a debugging agent replaced a money-path fix with the original buggy
# code tagged with an experimental scratch-revert marker (a TEMP-style prefix combined
# with a REVERT suffix — see the pattern list below) to demonstrate a repro, then capped
# before restoring it — leaving the money path broken while the build stayed green (no signal).
# It was caught only because a human re-grepped for SAVEPOINT. This hook makes that
# signal deterministic: it greps the change set (tracked diff + untracked files vs HEAD,
# the same set the rest of the pipeline scopes to) for danger markers and blocks.
#
# Two roles (same logic):
#   1. deployment-gate.sh sources/invokes it → a HARD deploy block (the money guarantee).
#   2. Wired as a Stop hook on debugging + implementation → the agent is told, before it
#      can stop, that it left a marker in the tree (exit 2 feeds stderr back to the model).
#
# Markers matched (word-boundary, case-insensitive; see the MARKERS regex below for the
# exact patterns — described here rather than spelled out literally, so this comment
# doesn't trip the very check it documents): a TEMP-style scratch tag combined with a
# REVERT suffix (optionally via an extra prefix word); a REVERT tag combined with an ME
# suffix; an XXX tag combined with a REVERT suffix; a phrase meaning the change must not
# be committed; and HACK/FIXME tags meaning remove-or-fix-before-shipping.
# Plain TODO/FIXME/XXX are NOT matched — those are normal and blocking on them would just
# train people to bypass the gate. Only experimental-revert or must-not-ship-class markers block.
#
# Exit: 0 = clean (or no change set / not a pipeline project) · 2 = marker found (BLOCK).

# false-block on a marker being *removed*). The state.json guard is skipped in CI (not a
# bootstrapped checkout); an unresolvable SCAN_BASE fails CLOSED (exit 2), never vacuous.
# Exit 2 on a hit is already the contract, so CI needs no separate failure path.
